            The aid is very useful due to the fact that it is easy to read and pleasing to the eyes based off the colors. Enough informations is provided to show the author's idea in what they would like to display but does not showcase a ton of stats that would take away from their entire presentation.

         There is so much wrong with this visual. For starters, the percentages do not add up to 100%, secondly the answer to the question asked is not even answered. Thirdly it is the wrong type of chart to display for answering that type of question.
